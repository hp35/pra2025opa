# Computer code, notes and supporting data for <em>Photoinduced flipping of optical chirality during backward-wave parametric amplification in a chiral nonlinear medium</em>, Phys. Rev. A (2025)

This repository contains all data, supporting computer code and notes
(`bwopatheory.tex`; plain TeX code) for the article <em>Photoinduced flipping
of optical chirality during backward-wave parametric amplification in a chiral
nonlinear medium</em> by Christos Flytzanis, Fredrik Jonsson and Govind P.
Agrawal, Physical Review A <b>112</b>, L021503 (2025).

## Compiling and running the code

Each Python program has a dedicated `main` block, allowing the code to be run as
```bash
$ cd python
$ python3 graphs.py
```
The TeX code for the notes can be compiled using the enclosed `Makefile` simply
by running
```bash
$ make
```
